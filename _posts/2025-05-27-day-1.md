what_i_learned: |
  Today marked the beginning of my work on the NeuroLink Assist project. I unboxed and assembled the prototype rig, which includes a Raspberry Pi, a wireless EEG headset, and basic motor control components. I familiarized myself with the OpenBCI GUI to monitor brainwave activity in real time and began configuring the data acquisition pipeline.

  I also started exploring how Python interfaces with the headset's BLE signals, preparing for real-time signal processing down the line.

blockers: |
  The EEG headset’s Bluetooth module was initially unstable on Linux, which caused inconsistent connections. After diving into the forums and tweaking the `udev` rules and permissions, I managed to stabilize the connection. I’ll still need to test robustness in mobile conditions.

reflection: |
  It was exciting to finally dive into the tools I’ve read about in papers. Seeing my own brainwaves visualized on the screen gave me a deeper appreciation for the complexity and power of neural data. I’m especially curious to see how we’ll map these patterns to robotic assistance in future sessions.
