what_i_learned: |
  Today was a highly productive and insightful day in my research journey. Meeting with my Principal Investigator (P.I.) and Graduate Mentor helped me gain a clearer understanding of the expectations and structure of my research project. I was introduced to various Kaggle courses, covering essential topics like Python, Machine Learning, Pandas, and Computer Vision, which will undoubtedly enhance my technical skills. Being placed in the Intermediate/Advanced Python course (Python 102) was both exciting and challenging, as I deepened my understanding of lists, sets, and dictionaries. To close out the program, we played Headbands via Zoom, a lively guessing game where a chosen player was placed in a breakout room, then returned to the main room to ask yes-or-no questions to figure out what was written on their card. It was a fun way to end the session with teamwork and laughter.

  No blockers faced today.

reflection: |
  Writing a small program using dictionaries allowed me to apply my learning in a practical setting, reinforcing key programming concepts. The absence of any blockers today made the experience even smoother, giving me confidence in my ability to navigate the coursework and research tasks effectively. Overall, I feel motivated to continue building upon these skills and look forward to further engaging in the learning process.
