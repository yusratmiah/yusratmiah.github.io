what_i_learned: |
  I started working with EEG recordings collected during baseline tests using the OpenBCI headset. Using Python and matplotlib, I visualized raw brainwave activity and began identifying alpha wave bursts associated with closed-eye relaxation states. 

  I also implemented a basic bandpass filter to isolate frequencies between 8–12Hz, which are useful for emotion-related tasks. Additionally, I learned how artifacts like eye blinks and jaw clenching can interfere with clean EEG analysis.

blockers: |
  The initial plots were noisy and hard to interpret. It turns out the electrodes weren’t making consistent contact. After adjusting electrode placements and grounding, the signals improved. I still need a more robust pipeline for removing motion artifacts and environmental noise.

reflection: |
  Seeing the filtered EEG patterns made the data feel much more real. I’m starting to see how crucial clean inputs are before even thinking about classification. Tomorrow, I’ll start prototyping a live attention monitor using thresholding on alpha power levels.
