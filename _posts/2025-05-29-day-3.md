  We started the day with an engaging presentation on computer vision by Andrew Kelly from CEAMLS SAIRI '23, where I learned the key differences between image classification, used to recognize and label objects, and object detection, which involves identifying objects and drawing bounding boxes around them. Following the presentation, I used Google’s Teachable Machine to train an image classification model with three car classes: Porsche, Audi, and Volkswagen. Later, we transitioned to Google Colab, where we wrote short programs to experiment with both images and video, exploring the powerful object detection capabilities of the YOLOv8 model by Ultralytics.

  Later in the day, I participated in a virtual Escape Room activity with my project team using “Alone Together” by Enchambered. It was a unique and enjoyable experience that required each of us to share clues from our screens, none of which were identical, making communication and collaboration absolutely essential. It was not only a fun mental challenge but also a great way to build trust and teamwork.

  In the afternoon, we dove into the Python 102 bootcamp, where we tackled more advanced programming tasks. One of the highlights was building a functional Python gradebook that could store student names and grades, update and delete entries, and calculate averages, all accessible through a terminal interface. We also worked on a set of problem-solving challenges that deepened our understanding of core programming concepts. These included creating a word frequency counter using dictionaries, comparing users’ favorite fruits using set operations, and working with file input/output to write, read, and append text files. Each task helped reinforce my Python skills through practical, hands-on coding.

  One of the main challenges I faced today was keeping up with the pacing of the problem-solving challenges during the Python 102 bootcamp. While I was able to follow along with most of the concepts, some of the exercises required more time and focus than the schedule allowed. This made it a bit difficult to fully digest and apply certain techniques in real time, especially when transitioning quickly between topics like dictionaries, sets, and file I/O.
  
reflection: |
  Despite the fast pace, today was incredibly productive and full of learning. I enjoyed the mix of hands-on coding, collaborative problem-solving, and technical presentations. Each activity pushed me to think critically, communicate more clearly with my teammates, and expand my programming toolkit. The Escape Room was a great reminder that strong teamwork is just as important in tech as technical skills, and the coding challenges reinforced the value of persistence and practice. I’m looking forward to reviewing the concepts at my own pace to solidify what I learned.
