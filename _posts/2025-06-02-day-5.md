  Today was an informative and hands-on day where I deepened my understanding of file I/O processes in Python and explored foundational concepts in Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs). In the first half of the day, I tackled several problem-solving challenges that focused on working with files. These included building a "Line Counter" to count the number of lines in a file, creating a script to "Search for a Word in File," and writing a program to "Copy Contents to Another File." These exercises helped reinforce skills in reading from and writing to files, as well as string manipulation and basic control flow in Python.

  Following that, I completed two structured labs: the "Number Analysis Lab," where I processed numerical data from a file to calculate statistics like max, min, and average; and the "City Weather Log Analyzer," which involved parsing structured weather data and extracting meaningful summaries. These labs emphasized working with structured data, loops, conditionals, and modular code organization.

  In the second half of the day, I attended a presentation on Generative AI and LLMs, which offered a comprehensive overview of how AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning differ in scope and application. The presentation also introduced how LLMs are trained, the capabilities of generative models, and some current real-world use cases.

  Later, I collaborated with fellow researchers on an applied task: identifying whether images were AI-generated or captured by a real camera. This exercise highlighted the challenges in distinguishing synthetic content from authentic media and sparked discussions around digital literacy, model bias, and the future of AI-generated visuals.

reflection: |
  I strengthened my understanding of file handling in Python through practical challenges and labs. I also gained valuable insights into Generative AI and LLMs, particularly the differences between AI, machine learning, and deep learning. 
  The session on detecting AI-generated images was engaging and helped connect theory to real-world applications. Overall, it was a productive day that combined hands-on coding with foundational AI concepts.
