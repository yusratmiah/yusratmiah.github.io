  We started off by formally meeting the CEAMLS SAIRI AI Institute leadership team, faculty/graduate mentors, and undergraduate research participants. The leadership team includes Dr. Gabriella Waters, Dr. Kofi Nyarko, and Dr. Naja Mack, who all collectively oversee the program. There was also a collective discussion about the importance of gaining education about Artificial Intelligence because there is a lot of bias around us and digital media has reached a point where it cannot be trusted with further research from individuals consuming the media. 
  After the introductions, Dr. Waters gave an interactive presentation that highlighted the intersection of Machine Learning, Research Design, and Training Datasets. In particular, this presentation was a unique presentation since Dr. Waters utilized a simple analogy (in this case baking cookies) and introduced essential terminologies such as Independent/Dependent Variables, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Forward/Backward propagation, and epochs. 
  Once the presentation was over, we transitioned to a taking a group photo and did a team building activity. For the team building activity, it was a competition amongst the groups in which the group that was able to build the tallest structure with the provided materials (spagehetti and tape), while also balancing the given marshmellow on top, would win and get bragging rights. Although my group (Project 4 Group) did not win, we had a great time getting familiar with one another in-person.
  Lastly, on the second half of the day, we spent time in our assigned lab spaces. My group and I are assigned in the Center for the Built Environment & Infastructure Studies, which is located in the North Side of campus. Our graduate mentor briefly went over the expectations in the lab and assigned our goals for this week. This weeks goals are read literature papers and build a pipeline. Then, we all worked independently on reading literature papers and working on Kaggle Courses to familiarize ourselves with the topics (ML, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision) in our research.

blockers: |
  The blocker I faced today was getting the flow of things. I am new to the campus, so I lot of things was not familiar to me. 
  
reflection: |
  I strengthened my understanding of machine learning concepts by making progress in the Kaggle course. I also learned the importance of reading literature papers since they are great way to gain insight on methodologies that can be employed for experimental design. My goal for tomorrow is to finish the machine learning and deep learning courses on Kaggle and organize a nice note page of terms that I are new to me.
