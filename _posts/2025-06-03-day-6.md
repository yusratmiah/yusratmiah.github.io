what_i_learned: |
  I started my day off by coming into the lab at 9:30am sharp and started to work today. My Graduate mentor tasked our group to read the assigned literature papers an in-depth manner. Paritculary, I annotated all the papers and compiled a summary doc with all the key takeaways from the four papers I was assigned. This helped me be prepared with for the Project Team meeting that we had at 12:00pm today. While reading the four papers that I was assigned, I learned more about the different ways to detect driver drowsiness (via Electrooculography (EOG), Infrared camera-based techniques, and through the hybrid methods). It certainly was not easy to read the lengthy papers, however, it gave me good insight on the research project that I will working in this summer. It also taught me the importance of reading as a researchers as it helps generates new ideas through the exposure of various contents. 
  Another big part of the day was to make good progress on completing the Intro Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision on courses. I was able to successfully complete the Machine Learning and Deep Learning courses on Kaggle. Through these courses, I learned about how ML models work (via decision trees, model validation, and randomization) and how Deep Learning models work (via neural networks, optimization, normalization, and classification.
  Lastly, my graduate mentor did a phenomenal job giving a demonstaration about building a pipeline via GoogleColab. He emphasized the three key features of a pipeline: train, testing, and deploying. A good overview of Long short term memory (LSTM) as it helps build accuracy within the model.

  There was a lot of deep learning terms that I was unfamiliar with. I had to consult outside resources (articles and videos) to eliminate the gap in knowledge. 
  
reflection: |
  I learned how to manage my time effectively during my first full day in lab. I personally enjoyed the experience a lot since it felt like I was truly working 9-5pm at an office like setting. I also felt very comfortable speaking and sharing my thoughts during the meeting and was able to participate in a productive discussion with my peers & mentor. I am looking forward to more days in the lab!
