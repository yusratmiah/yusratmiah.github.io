what_i_learned: |
  The day began with a collective group campus tour of Morgan State University. Throughout the tour, I was able to see the modern facilities, hear more about opportunities, and meet new people within the CEAMLES SAIRI cohort. I found the campus itself to be very inviting to students. The notable part of the tour was discovering the rather sceanic trail that goes from the area of Holmes Hall all the way to the Center of Built 
Environment & Infrastructure Studies. I mention this because the lab I work for is located in the Center of Built Environment & Infrastructure Studies, which is quite a walk from the center of campus. I also interacted with members from the Project 7 and Project 8 during the lunch break after discovering that their office across the floor of the building I sit in. 
After the lunch break, I went back to the lab and continued to make progress on finishing my Computer Vision course on Kaggle, writing my literature review, and creating my slide for the video presentation due tomorrow. Through the Computer Vision course today, I learned about sliding windows, which is able to capture more detailed patterns of an image through processing overlapping sections that are smaller in size. I was able to finish my slide for the video presentation and complete two pages out of the four pages for my literature review.

  I wanted to gain further insight on Convoltion, ReLU, and Maxpooling, so I watched short 10 minute lectures on these topics.

reflection: |
  Learning how the computer "sees" through layers of neural networks was eye-opening for me. It helped me grasp the importance of deep learning algorithms and why it is so important to learn about the various models. I hope to do further research on the Mobilenetv2, Densenet121, and EfficeintB0 models to possibly utilize them for the predictive model that my project group will build. My goal for tomorrow is to finish up the Computer Vision Course on Kaggle and finish writing my draft for my literature review.
