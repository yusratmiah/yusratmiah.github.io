what_i_learned: |
The day began with a collective group campus tour of Morgan State University. Throughout the tour, I was able to see the modern facilities, hear more about opportunities, and meet new people within the CEAMLES SAIRI cohort. I found the campus itself to be very inviting to students. The notable part of the tour was discovering the rather sceanic trail that goes from the area of Holmes Hall all the way to the Center of Built 
Environment & Infrastructure Studies. I mention this because the lab I work for is located in the Center of Built Environment & Infrastructure Studies, which is quite a walk from the center of campus. I also interacted with members from the Project 7 and Project 8 during the lunch break after discovering that their office across the floor of the building I sit in. 
After the lunch break, I went back to the lab and continued to make progress on finishing my Computer Vision course on Kaggle, writing my literature review, and creating my slide for the video presentation due tomorrow. Through the Computer Vision course today, I learned about sliding windows, which is able to capture more detailed patterns of an image through processing overlapping sections that are smaller in size. I was able to finish my slide for the video presentation and complete two pages out of the four pages for my literature review.

  There was no significant blockers faced today.
  
reflection: |
  I would say I had a pretty good day today as I got to interact with a lot more members of the program (met about six people today)! My group members and I also helped each other out as a teamate was having issues with their computer setup, which was a good team bonding experience. I can improve my computer vision skills by reviewing the terminology (like make a quizlet). My goal for tomorrow is to finish up my literature review, complete the last part of the CV cource on Kaggle, and film the video with my team.
