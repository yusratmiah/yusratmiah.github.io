what_i_learned: |
  I started my day by completing the Computer Vision course on Kaggle. I learned about the application of the "sliding window" as it is used to observe feature extraction on low resolution images to see individual pixles and how the receptive field goes hand-in-hand as it tells which parts of the input image of a neuron receives information from. The features themseleves that are picked out depends on the pattern on numbers in the kernel. These numbers somewhere between 0.0 (black and dark) and 1.0 (white and bright). The key aspect of convnets in general is that they will repeat extraction repeatedly so that the features become more complex and refined as they travel deep into the network. 
  I also participated in a research study relating to ground drones on the road by driving on a driving simulator and wearing a glasses sensor. My group and I also filmed our Week 2 reflection video.

  I consulted a video by 3blue1Brown about Sliding Windows in the Convulution.

reflection: |
  I plan on enhancing my literature review. I also will practice the skills that I gained this week through the computer vision module. Next week, I hope to enhance my knowledge about the deep learning models that we will use. Lastly, I would say this week was very productive, and hope to learn more next week. I will also look into systematic literature review.
