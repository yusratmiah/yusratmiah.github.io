  As it is the first day of Week 3, I began my day off by first reviewing this week's goals that was set by my graduate mentor, Dr. Pelumi. While reviewing the goals, I noticed that a key focus point for the week is to understand the strength and weaknesses of the 5 proposed CNN architectures (Mobilenet (v1 and v2), densenet121, efficient B0 (v1 and v2)) that we will use for our research. To start this task, I found a good 12 part video series on YouTube explaining the ins and outs of MobileNet. I primarily focusd on version 1 of MobileNet (MobileNetV1) and explored how it is based on depthwise seperable convolution (DSC), which is a method of convolution that reduced the computational cost and numbers of parameter, while still maintatin descent acccuracy. Through this process, I was able to grasp the understanding of how the cost of an CNN is measured: # of elements per kernel times # of positions taken per kernel. 
  Then later in the morning, Dr. Pelumi did a small workshop on how to find good scholarly articles. In particular, I discovered how to the universities' A-Z databases (particularly the SCOPUS database) can be help to narrow the search for scholarly articles. I mention this because it allows researchers to go beyond Google Scholar since, at the end of the day, Google Scholar is just a search engine and not a database. Dr. Pelumi also emphasized the importance of continously reading the journal articles since a "better reader means better writer" at the end of the day.
  After lunch, I started working towards the certification on the Machine Learning with Python Course on freeCodeCamp. I specifically completed the Machiine Learning fundamentals and TensorFlow portions. I still have quite a few modules to complete and plan to also work on the course outside of the lab. Next, I gave feedback on Canvas to complete the Week 2 Discussion post. I particularly commented on the skin cancer diagnonsis and urban pollution projects by suggesting SCOPUS database and by asking questions pertaining to data collection.

  I did have to slow down the MobilenetV1 explanation videos to take some notes and understand the mathematical explanations of the architecture overall.

  I would say that I had a productive day in the lab. I was able to take intitiative on my own and find the Machine Learning with Python Course on freeCodeCamp. I liked learning about free resources to enhance my research experience. My goals for tommorrow include the following: Finish parts parts 8 to 12 videos about the Deep Learning and complete parts 8 to 16 of Machine Learning with Python course.
