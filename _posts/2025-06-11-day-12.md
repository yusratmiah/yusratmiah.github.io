what_i_learned: |
  I started my day off by running the MobileNetV1 model on the GoogleColab codebase, which approximately took to 45 minutes to run. My team and I also had a progress check with our graduate mentor, Pelumi, and we discussed the setbacks we are facing and the importance of understanding the evaluation metrics for the different models, since such metrics are critical for analysis. Specifically, evaluation metrics such as the confusion matrix, accuracy, and precision values are important to decipher and explain. Then, I tried to run the MobileNetV2 model on the GoogleColab code using Google's given GPU but that did not run successfully since Google has a GPU allowance for individuals using the free version. Because of this setback, I had to research my own ways to figure out how to adjust the existing code and run it either directly on my local machine or on my computer's virtual machine (Ubantu). I ended up going the Ubantu route since I could directly create isolated enviroments, which is great for downloading various packages such as tensorflow, skitlearn, pythin libraries, etc. To this successfully, I had to go through various resources such as articles, forums, and YouTube videos. It was definetly a learning curve and allowed me to work with new software that I previously did not work with. I also read and analyzed a one journal article today titled "YOLOdrive: A Lightweight Autonomous Driving Single-Stage Target Detection Approach".

  It did take some time for me to set up the space locally to run the ML codebase. 

reflection: |
  I unexpectedly learned a lot about working with a virtual environment. I feel like one thing led to another: for example python versions byond 3.11 will not work for tensorflow currently, so I had to download a lower version of python. I also got a taste of Anaconda, which is bundles essential python, data science, and machine learning tools, while also providing and isolated envionment. I expecially liked exploring the pre-built data science tools and libraries. My goals for tomorrow include improving my analysis for the different models and hopefully finish running the MobilenetV2 mode.
