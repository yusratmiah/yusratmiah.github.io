what_i_learned: |
  My day started off with meeting up with everyone in the common space in the business building. We all met and updated Dr. Mack briefly about what our groups have been up to for the past 1.5 weeks. Then, we transitioned into playing the game "Taboo," in which the cohort was split into two teams and one member from each team went to the front of the room, picked a card and tried to describe the word without saying any of the listed similar words on the card. THe game got competeive real quick and really showed the importance of communication when being in a big group. We also played a quick game of Jenga and then went to another room in the building to get a tutorial on Overleaf. During the Overleaf tutorial, I learned how Overleaf is used more in academia and formal report settings as the IDE ultilizes LaTex and minimizes formatting issues. We specifically make a document version of our blog on Overleaf. 
  The second half of the day was back to good 'ol research. I tried to run the Google Colab codebase locally on my computer. However, I ran into multiple issues pretaining to storage, incompatible software, etc and just ended running the notebook using the Google GPU since the percentage block reset (free version). I also looked in more about ensembling models on top of another by reading a short article and watching a video on it.

  The issues relating to running the codebase locally; I realized my personal laptop isn't so powerful (16 gb RAM and no NVIDIA GPU chip).

reflection: |
  Today definetly flew by due to the first half of the day. I will have to do some work outside of the lab today. For example, I will have to rerun some of the models since I did not realize that I needed to change the name of the model on multpliple locations on the codebase (in two places, not just one). My goals for tomorrow include finalizing my progress report and exploring more literature resourouses and doing some stacking.
