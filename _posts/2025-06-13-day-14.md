reflection: |
  Today definetly flew by due to the first half of the day. I will have to do some work outside of the lab today. For example, I will have to rerun some of the models since I did not realize that I needed to change the name of the model on multpliple locations on the codebase (in two places, not just one). My goals for tomorrow include finalizing my progress report and exploring more literature resourouses and doing some stacking.
