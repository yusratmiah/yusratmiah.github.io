what_i_learned: |
  This week, I organized slides with detailed notes covering MobileNetV1, MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB0, EfficientNetV2, and DenseNet-121 in preparation for a meeting with my mentor, where we discussed model evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. I also created and recorded the presentation for the Week 3 video using Zoom. Additionally, I attempted to set up the codebase in the lab’s local environment to run on available machines. The effort was unsuccessful due to permission restrictions.

blockers: |
  The main blocker I encountered was the lack of admin access, which prevented me from installing necessary dependencies on the lab machines.

reflection: |
  Reflecting on the week, I feel that I made solid progress in understanding and communicating key model architectures and evaluation metrics. While the technical setup issue slowed down practical implementation, it highlighted the importance of infrastructure readiness. I now have a stronger grasp of model selection trade-offs and am better prepared to experiment with them. Next week, my focus will be on using DenseNet-121 and applying scaling strategies by training at different epoch levels, optimizing the model, and exploring regularization techniques to improve generalization.
