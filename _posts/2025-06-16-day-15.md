what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned about the depths of DenseNet-121 through studying concepts such as dense connectivity and how it has reduced parameters. Through this, I was able to explore ideas such as back propagation (used to go back from the output to the input and how it mitigates the issue with the vanishing gradient problem as it updates the weights and biases of earlier connections. Then, I attempted to run the codebase locally on the Morgan State provided computers and ran into some issues with downloading the packages. However, through debugging this issues I became very comfortable with the conda environment (like making virtual environments and creating local hosts to connect with local cpu/gpu)

blockers: |
  By not having admin access, using conda is taking up time especially with the setup process. 

reflection: |
  I certainly feel more comfortable with core densenet-121 architecture. I also am more confident with managing version control of different softwares (python and tensorflow). I learned how not all packages/versions are compatabile with one another. My goal tomorrow is to fix the issue of running the code locally and read more papers about densenet-121
