  The day started off with the cohort meetup in the Graves Business Building. Dr. Mack reminded us of some expectations, such as writing thoughtful blog posts, arriving and leaving the research lab on time, reviewing the guidelines for the weekly video, and preparing for the upcoming Midsummer Symposium presentation that will take place on Friday, June 27, 2025. After reviewing expectations, we did our first group activity, which was to come up with a 30-second pitch for our project. The interesting part of this activity was that in our 30-second speech, we were not allowed to include any words from our project title, since the main objective was for our high school teacher to guess our group's project. Our group came up with the following pitch: "Our project leverages computer vision and deep learning by utilizing different convolutional neural networks to observe facial cues such as eye position and yawning to enhance transportation safety." When we practiced our pitch in front of the cohort, we did it flawlessly. I mention this because we genuinely put in a lot of effort, first by combining our ideas and then timing the delivery to see what could be added or removed. Next, we did another group activity called Lost at Sea, in which we were given a list of 15 items and asked to rank them from most to least important. As a group, we prioritized food items to ensure that individuals would be nourished and survive the hardship of being stranded at sea. Later in the morning and into the afternoon, we were introduced to our assigned high school teacher. It was great getting to know Eneaya, and I walked her around the north side of the Morgan campus to show her around. This gave me a chance to get to know her better. I learned that she teaches AP Language and 10th-grade English and is from upstate New York. We also did a fun icebreaker with her where we each listed three favorite songs: one from childhood, one from middle or high school, and one current favorite. Once we got settled in the lab, I took screenshots of the results from the model I had been running overnight on a workstation. I spent some time interpreting the data and found that the model had slightly improved in accuracy. I then set up two more runs, which I will let run overnight. My team member Michelle and I were able to get Google Colab to run locally on our designated workstation by creating a new Conda environment and redownloading all the packages and libraries from scratch. This was a great example of collaboration, as we both helped each other and learned the importance of software version control, especially since not all versions of Python work with all versions of TensorFlow. Additionally, I made progress on my literature review by finding more papers on SCOPUS. I plan to read and annotate them after work today. I also learned how to maximize the performance of the Intel(R) Iris(R) Xe Graphics card on my personal laptop by updating the drivers and tweaking GPU utilization, frequency, voltage, and power metrics (I increased each to either the maximum or the 95th/99th percentile). This helped reduce the time per epoch when running the model.

blockers: |
  There were some blockers with running the code locally, but we finally reoslved them after 3 days of dealing the issues!

reflection: |
  Today was balanaced and productive day. I feel like as a group we are more comfortable with synthesizing our ideas together and come up with things that are meaningful. I really enjoyed getting to know our high school teacher and having a group discussion everyone on our team (grad mentor included). My goal for tommorrow is to bring my data from the model runs together and compare/contrasts the findings.
