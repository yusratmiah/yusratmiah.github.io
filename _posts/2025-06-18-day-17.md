  The day started off with the cohort meetup in the Graves Business Building. Dr. Mack reminded us of some expectations such as writing thoughtful blog posts, ariving and leaving the research lab on time, reviewing the guidelines of the weekly video, and going over the expectations for the upcoming midsummer symposiam presentation that will take place Friday, June 27th, 2025. After the review of expectations, we did our first group activity, which was to come up with a 30 second pitch of our project. The interesting part of this activity was that in our 30 seconds speech, we were not allowed to include any words from our project title since the main objective was that our high school teacher would have to guess our group's project. Our group came up with the following pitch: "Our project leverages computer vision and deep learning by utilizing different convolution neural networks to observe facial cues such as eye postion and yawning to enhance transportation safety." When we practiced our pitch in front of the cohort, we did it flawlessly, and I mention this because we truly did put in a lot of effort in making sure our pitch was well thoughout by first bringing our ideas together and then timing it out to see what can be added and removed. Next, we did another group activity name <insert name>, in which we were given a list of 15 items and then were told to rank them by most important to least important. We as a group prioritized food items to ensure that individuals were nourished and survived the hardship of being stranted in the sea. Later in the morning and in the afternoon, we were introduced to our assigned high school teacher. It was great getting to know Eneaya, and I walked her to the North side of the Morgan campus and showed her around. This allowed me to get her to her better (learned that she teaches AP Language and 10th grade english and is from upstate NY). We also did a cool ice breaker with her about listing 3 favorite songs (1 from childhood, 1 from middle/high school, and 1 from now). Then, once we got settled in the lab, I took screenshots of the results of the model that I was running overnight on a workstation. I spent some time interpretting the data and found that the model did improve the accuracy slightly. I then set up two other runs and will leave the running overnight. My team member Michelle and I was able to get Google Colab to run locally now on our designated wrokstation by creating a new conda environement and redownloading all the oackages/libraries from the ground up. This was a prime example of collobaoration since we both helped each other out and learned the importance of software version control since not all versions of Python will interact with all versions of tensorflow. Additionally, I did some work on my literature review by finding more papers on SCOPUS. I plan on reading the papers and annotating them after work today. I also learned how to maximize the performance of my Intel(R) Iris(R) Xe Graphics card on my personal laptop by updating the drivers and tweaking the GPU Utilization, GPU Frequency, GPU Voltage, and GPU Power metrics (I upped all the metrics to either Max, 95th/99th percentile). This helped reduce the time per epochs when running the model.

blockers: |
  There were some blockers with running the code locally, but we finally reoslved them after 3 days of dealing the issues!

reflection: |
  Today was balanaced and productive day. I feel like as a group we are more comfortable with synthesizing our ideas together and come up with things that are meaningful. I really enjoyed getting to know our high school teacher and having a group discussion everyone on our team (grad mentor included). My goal for tommorrow is to bring my data from the model runs together and compare/contrasts the findings.
