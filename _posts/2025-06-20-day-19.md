what_i_learned: |
  My morning started off with a group meeting with my team's graduate mentor, Pelumi. In this meeting, we reviewed some expectations and plans for the upcoming weeks such as discussing findings and progress by each group members. After the meeting, we went back to our work, and I finished writing my notes about the Google Colab code. Particularly, I wrote detailed comments on the code to better understand what is truly happening in the code base. By doing this, it helped me better understand what hyperparamters could be adjusted to make effective changes when working with the DenseNet-121 model. I then proceeded to create three sepearte notebooks, which each had a different focus area: add dropout to prevent overfitting, fewer layer units, and deeper network layers. I also in the process learned how to convert jupyter notebooks to html and pdf formats since the deafult way to convert a jupyter notebook into a pdf often omits critical information and messes up the format. I specifcally researched and found the commands to convert the notebooks to html and pdfs, and then shared them with my groupmates once I figured it out. Lastly, we did one more check-in with Pelumi to review next week's goals and filmed our week 4 video.

  There were no blockers today.

reflection: |
  I had a productive day since I was able to finish some critical tasks. I feel more comfortable with my organize methods for collecting data. I hope to research more about DenseNet-121 since it will be important to explain it in layman's terms for the mid-summer symposium. My goal next week is to run more models and enhance my coding/technical writing skills.
