  My The day began in the Graves Business Building with a Cohort meeting with Dr. Mack, where she went over the expectations of the program and the upcoming group presentations that will take place on Friday, June 27th. In particular, Dr. Mack explained the importance of preparing for the presentation since it will be a good way to gauge on what still needs to be accomplished for the rest of the summer and also will be a good way to show case what each group has accomplished so far. I liked how she emphasized that each group should practice their presenations to ensure that timing is right (somewhere between 15-20 minutes long). After the meeting ended, I went back to my lab and continued to fine-tune my DenseNet-121 model by running some models with a larger epoch number and with different hyperparameters. While running the first iteration of the model today, I noticed that per epoch took around 30-45 mins, which was still signifcantly slow even though I was connected locally on to my work station computer that has an NVIDIA GPU. I then checked my setup in my Anaconda environment and realized that my Juoyter notebook local host was not detecting the GPU. This led me to debug the environment install process by first checking the python and tensorflow versions, and then redownloading/installing consulting the medium post titled, "Install CUDA, cuDNN in conda virtual environment and setup GPU support using Tensorflow." From there, I did the following: 1) Installing CUDA, cuDNN with conda-forge 2) Installing Tensorflow GPU and lastly, 3) installing a version numpy that is LESS than 2.0.0. Once I completed these steps, I was able to utlized the GPU, and it was evident that the GPU was in use since the time per epoch reduced to somewhere betweeen 2 to 15 minutes! I was also able to help my group members who were encountering the same issues. Lastly, we virtually met up with our graduate mentor to discuss what slides each of us will be working on for the presentation on Friday. I jotted down detail notes during the meeting and will organize the notes for reference. I also setup another model with 64 epochs, Adam optimzier, sigmoid activation, and batch size of 64 that will run over night. Towards the end, I started to read the paper titled, "ntelligent Deep Convolutional Neural Network Based Object Detection Model
for Visually Challenged People."

  I did face a little bit of a challenge with making sure my GPU was detected by my program and activated within my Conda environment.

  I had a pretty slow day since I was running a model and the climate control was down in the building in the morning. It is also very hot outside, which made my wallk over to the North side of campus harder than usual. I was able to find a journal article similar to our project titled "Driver Distraction Classification Using Deep Convolutional Autoencoder and Ensemble Learning." This was inspiring since it gave me a better overview about what our final product may look like.
