  My day started off with completing the Week 4 Video Discussion Assignment, where I watched and annotated the videos of Group 13 and Group 5. From Group 13's video, I learned about how leveraging existing datasets to train a machine learning model, along with creating a data visualization dashboard for real-time forecasting, can significantly streamline operations for both airport personnel and passenger. Then, from Group 5's video, I got insight on that low accuracy when initially implementing AI models seems to be a common pitfall. 
  I then transitioned into running a DenseNet-121 model with fewer parameters and got an accuracy of 53%. I posulate the reasoning behind this is due to the reduced number of deep layers. Additionally, to further solidify my understanding of image recognition and machine learning code, I watched a 1.5 hour video titled "Build a Deep CNN Image Classifier with ANY Images." By doing so, I wrote some of my own code and tweaked some features. We also met up with another graduate student named Oyinkansola Aladeokin to discuss our overall progress so far. During this discussion, I was able to grasp the process of how papers are accepted in academia as I was unaware about the somewhat hefty pricetag involved for immediate open source availability for papers.
  Lastly, I worked on creating a python program that detects duplicate images since our dataset has multiple duplicate images, which significanlty slows down our runtime.

  I did face a little bit of a challenge with making sure my GPU was detected by my program and activated within my Conda environment.
  
reflection: |
  I had a pretty slow day since I was running a model and the climate control was down in the building in the morning. It is also very hot outside, which made my wallk over to the North side of campus harder than usual. I was able to find a journal article similar to our project titled "Driver Distraction Classification Using Deep Convolutional Autoencoder and Ensemble Learning." This was inspiring since it gave me a better overview about what our final product may look like.
