what_i_learned: |
  I began my day analyzing the model that I ran overnight in my work computer. Specifically, the model I ran had 64 epochs with the AdamW optimizer. I chose to explore this set of parameters since I learned that AdamW is a more optimized version of the commonly used Adam optimizer and a teammate of mine had positive outcomes using AdamW. It was interesting to see that the model itself finished running at 3:30am. I did get really good results, and to verify the results, I also ran a similar version of this model but with earlystopping, which stopped the model when the loss evaluation metrics became constant. After doing these tasks, I read the article titled "Detecting Driver Drowsiness Using Hybrid Facial Features and Ensemble Learning," which helped me gain a new presepective about a research study similar to ours. 
  Next, I worked with my group member Michelle to highlight the documentation of how to utilize the GPU and filmed the weekly video.

  I did have to look into some readings to correctly interpurt some results.

  Today flew by and it was great colloborative experience overall. I liked reading more literature papers about the topic. I also was able to comprehend a lot more deep learning terminologies. I am looking forward to a productive week ahead.
