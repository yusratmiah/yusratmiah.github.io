what_i_learned: |
  My day started off by completing the Week 5 Video Discussion posts. I particularly responded to the "The African Diaspora Media Hub" and "Smart Water Contamination Detection Using AI Model" groups. Through these projects I learned about consolidating data to make meaningful website to enilghten individuals of the rich, beautiful culture within the African Diaspora and how hardware-software interactions have a lot of potential to create a cost effective solution to address critical water contamination issues.
  Then, I transitioned into studying more about CUDA in general since I feel like I was too technically sound with it. I watched a video interview about it explained by one of the architects of CUDA named Stephen Jones. He explained how CUDA brings together the CPU and GPU and that CUDA assigns different tasks to the CPU and GPU. For example, CUDA will assign loading config files and Fetch API tasks to the CPU, while on the other hand, it will give the GPU a more memory intensive task like processing image.
  Lastly, after researching about Optuna here and there for a couple of weeks, I finally implemented on my code base and am running a study on a Google Colab Notebook, which is connected with my local machine. Note there are some major steps for integrating Optuna for hyperparameter tuning: 1) Installing Optuna 2) Defining the Objective function- training different hyperparameters 3) Modifying model training 4) Analyze Results 5) Summarize the results/present best model.
