what_i_learned: |
  Today, I started my day by writing my progress slide for the upcoming Mid-Summer Presentation. The progress slide itself had three major segments- contributions & achievements, challenges encountered, and solutions implemented. By working on this portion of the presentation, it truly helped me reflect my journey overall because I realized I have been able to accomplish a good amount of tasks and gain a multitude of skills in a short period of time. For example, I became very comfortable with using JupyterLab to write code and became good at implementing and testing various deep learning models related to my AI non-contact DDD research. I became good at debugging model behavior, understanding loss trends, and fine-tuning hyperparameters to improve performance. I also deepened my knowledge of data preprocessing techniques, especially when working with sensor or signal-based datasets. Writing the progress slide reminded me how much I’ve grown in working independently, interpreting model outputs, and adapting to feedback from my mentor or team.
  Later in the day, we met with my mentor to get feedback on our presentation slides. During the meeting, we reviewed each slide together and made edits in real time based on the feedback. We also received valuable advice on our presentation delivery; specifically, to avoid reading directly from the slides, to speak with enthusiasm, and to project our voices clearly to engage the audience.

  We ended the program early today due to severe weather (1 hour early).
  
reflection: |
  Today helped me realize how much I’ve grown during my research experience so far. Writing the progress slide made me reflect on the technical skills I’ve gained, especially in coding and deep learning. Meeting with our mentor gave us helpful feedback to improve both our slides and presentation style. Even though the day ended early due to weather, it still felt productive and meaningful.
