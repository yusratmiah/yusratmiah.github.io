  My day began bright and early with my arriving at the lab at 8:25 am due to the bus schedule and to get head start to a long day. I knew going into today that there would be a lot of loose ends fix related to our group's slideshow presentation and live demo video since we still had to work on making these components visually appealing. I first started off my adding a unique stack of images of the journal articles I read, which was inspired by a groupmate. Then, my graduate mentor and my group did a demo round of presentations to see how much time it would take for us to complete the presentation. For this demo presentation, it took us around 21 minutes to go through the entire presentation, making us slightly over the time limit. However, I would say it was a good starting place since none of us really prepared in advance and said things inpromptu. We were recommended to shorten some slides down (like the literature review and premilinary findings slides).
  After the first demo presentations, we went back to editing and completing our prospective slides with me completing the DenseNet-121 findings slide. I particularly structured my slide to have a data tables highlighting the critical data points such as precision and accuracy. Going the extra mile with this also allowed me to organize my data and document my work at a high level.
  Once I was done with making all the necessary contributions to my group's presentation, I dedicated the rest of the day to editing the live demo video for the group and filming my portion of the demo. I took the lead into video editing because I personally am well-versed in this area with experiences from past projects. I like to edit videos too since it is fun to explore different editing software features. For my portion of the video, I discussed Dense-121 very briefly (24 secs) and the process of connecting locally to the lab PCs GPU on Google Collab (34 secs). With a maximum of 5 mins for the live demo (time constraint set by Dr. Pelumi), we each had roughly 75 seconds to present our part. I was cutting a bit close with editing the video since I had lot on my plate with such little time, so Michelle helped me with the video editing at times (we reviewed clips together and talked about cutting some parts). She also helped me create a QR code for the video. Overall, I am glad that our group completed everything at a high level where everything was thought out, organized, and submitted on time.

  Time was a little bit of a blocker since it was flying by fast but everyhting was done on time!
  
reflection: |
  Today was a prime example of the 9am-5pm hustle to ensure that deadlines are met. I sacrificed a large portion of my 1-hour lunch break to edit the video. I also had a large task on hand, which was to edit the video. This certainly meant that I had to deliver my best work since I lot was on stake. I still need to practice a little bit to ensure I am fully prepared for the presentation tomorrow.
