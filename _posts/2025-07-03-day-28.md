what_i_learned: |
  My day consisted of watching my peers present with their respective groups. My group and I presented in the second half of the day around 3pm. I did practice for about 45 minutes in the morning before coming to campus today. I also rehearsed my lines in my head to make sure I knew the lines. I realized that it was easier just to remember the main idea and some keywords of the slides rather than directly reading off the slides (that make it feel robotic/unnatural). Furthermore, it was fun catching up with other cohort members.
  
blockers: |
  I had a group member say a profane phrase to me via GroupMe because they accused of me of moving things around on their slide when in reality, I simply just changed the color of their title slide from orange to black in the "Preliminary Data Findings" section of the slide for consistency purposes. I felt utterly disrespected by them and am waiting for an apology from them because it shows a lack of professionalism, maturity, and respect on their part. We are group and we should all be in this together.
