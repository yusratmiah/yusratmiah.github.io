  For the first half of the day, I took intiative to learn more about how to possibly use "Real-Time" data on our team's deep learning model. Through this process, I learned about the complexities that come about with this task. A major challenge is making sure that program is able to detect a connection between the cellular device/camera and the PC's network. I discovered that there are open source tools like Droid Cam and OBS Studio to assist in accomplishing this task. However, through a series of trials and errors, I encovered that the school Wi-Fi makes the connection process diffcult due to Windows Firewall and lack of Windows Adminstrator Access.
  For the later half of the day, I worked on a different Densenet-121 model and tweaked that up to meet the standards. I found the program through reading the main Densenet-121 paper titled: "Densely Connected Convolutional Networks."

  Setbacks faced to retrieve real time video data.
  
reflection: |
  I would say I had a pretty slow day today. My graduate mentor emphasized the fact that this week would primarily for polishing our techinical writing piece. Therefore, I was motivated to brush up on some journal articles that I previously read. My goal for tomorrow includes the continuation of organizing the keypoints from the journal articles and to enhance my DenseNet-121 model.
