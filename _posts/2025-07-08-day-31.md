  To begin, I got to the lab and began exploring more ways to enhance our team's ensemble model. Our ensemble model is a crucial component in our project since it the product that will help our project standout by bringing together three major lightweight models together: MobileNet, EfficientNet, and DenseNet. To gain a better understanding on ensemble models, I looked into some publicly available GitHub repositories and attempted to run some of them locally on my lab PC. I did face some challenges running these ensemble models locally since my lab PC is running out of storage as there are many user profiles and other miscellaneous data stored within the PC. While I wasn't successful with running the models, it led me to another topic, which was understanding the key differences between Pytorch, Tensorflow, and Keras frameworks. I learned that Pytorch was developed by Meta and offers a comprehensive dynamic computational graph, while Tensorflow, on the other hand, was developed by Google and offers suitable statistical analysis quickly and has a subset called "tensorflow lite" for mobile app development. Furthermore, I now understand how "Keras" came about and that it is a high level API of Tensorflow that is great for beginners to create and experiment with neural networks. 
  The next half of the day was dedicated to spending time with the team to complete some team building and to begin our process for documenting our research through writing a comprehensive literature paper. My mentor instructed our group to focus on writing the abstract, introduction, and the literature review portions of the paper this week. I collaborated with a group member to write the problem statement part of the abstract today. I also ran two DenseNet-121 models today.

  Faced some setbacks related to lab pc storage today. This indicates that carrying an external hard drive or flash drive might be a good idea.
  
reflection: |
  I would say today was productive and led me to explore things related to our research. For example, I am inspired to see how to integrate a Deep Architecture on a mobile app now. Also, the team lunch today was great and allowed me to learn more about my group and mentor. Looking ahead, I realize that my time in CEAMLS SAIRI is narrowing down quickly, and I am motivated to end the summer on a high note.
