what_i_learned: |
  My day started with refactoring my codebase to run Optuna on the DenseNet-121 model. This required creating a new Conda environment with updated versions of Python, TensorFlow, Optuna, NumPy, and other necessary software packages. The setup process involved a bit of trial and error, as I had grown accustomed to using a single Conda environment—based on Python 3.9.23 and TensorFlow 2.10.0—that worked for all of my previous runs.
  Once I resolved the discrepancies related to running Optuna, I launched the Optuna session on the Google Colab codebase by connecting it to my local machine through Jupyter Notebook. Since Optuna is a resource-intensive process used to determine the optimal hyperparameters for the model (in this case, DenseNet-121), the run is expected to take just over a day—approximately 27 hours, assuming an average epoch duration of 27 minutes. I plan to run a total of 60 epochs.
  After that, I shifted focus to contributing to my group's literature paper draft, offering suggestions and edits to my teammates. I’ve been enjoying the collaborative process and feel optimistic about our final product.
  Additionally, I started a couple of LinkedIn Learning courses: Introduction to Analytics with AI on AWS and Complete Guide to C++ Programming Foundations. These are helping me deepen my understanding of industry practices and sharpen my technical skills.

  I did face some challenges with intiating the Optuna run but resolved the issue after consulting some documentation pages. 
  
reflection: |
  This week, the primary objective remains the same since we are collectively all making progress in drafting our technical paper. I am learning the importance of having advanced technial writing skills to throughly communicate ideas to others. Also, by watching lectures and tutorials by experts in fields relating to Deep Learning and Artificial Inteligence, I learned that mastery in a subject area is achieved once an individual is able to explain complex concepts simply and clearly. Therefore, I hope to work on enhancing my ability to communicate my group's research with these ideals.
