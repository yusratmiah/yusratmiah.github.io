  With the weekly CEAMLS SAIRI cohort meeting on Thursdays in the Business Building of Morgan State, I spent the first half of the day in a Technical Writing Workshop hosted by Dr. Anita Pandey. Through this workshop, I learned that the first thing to consider when writing is the audience because it sets the tone and level of formality/informatility within a piece. Dr. Pandey also recommended that our research groups should look into potential journal publishers since they may have varying format and styling prefences for literature papers. The key "hallmarks" of technical papers and presentations where the following: 1) professionalism = formal + postive language 2) ethicality (no misquoting or plagarism) 3) accuracy (in areas related to key vocabulary, format, content, methodology) 4) clarity (aim for short sentences that use plain English 5) Completenes (at the end of the day, writing encompasses effective research and findings). There were also short "sprints" of writing exercises that included formulating the context line (background) and the problem statement for our research topics.
  Once I got to the lab in the afternoon, I continued working the tasks that I started yesterday- running the Optuna Model for DenseNet-121, contributing my group's literature paper, and just enlightening myself on more new knowledge! I mention "learning something new" because I read some articles about meta-learning and metacognition. Interestingly, I would say that writing this blog itself is form of metacognition as it allows me to guage what I learned and how I can improve my learning experience. This also brings into prespective about the importance of interleaving instead of being stuck on working on the same task for long periods of time.
  Lastly, I organized an outline for the introduction portion of the paper and plan to complete that part tomorrow (draft version). I also analyzed my Optuna run and found that it will take beyond the 27 hours that I anticpiated yesterday and may instead take somewhere between 4-8 days. To document the Optuna process, I curated a data table to organize the average times and results of each trial runs. I do have a long way to go with the Optuna run since I opted for 30 trials, which will ceertainly be taxing towards the GPU resources avialble and will take a while. However, I am entusiatic to see the end results.

  No blockers faced today.
  
reflection: |
  Today was an interesting day since the writign workshop reinforced that the skill of writing is a lifelong journey. I am also facing the lengthy times with Optuna and am trying my best to stay patient with it. I plan to run a new model of DenseNet-121 with the initial results of Optuna given so far (best parameters): learning_rate': 0.000261802310728809; 'optim': 'Adam'; 'dropout': 0.4. My goal for tomorrow is to end the week on a good note.
