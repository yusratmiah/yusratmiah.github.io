  My day began with the analysis of the Optuna model that I have been running for the past 2 days now. On average, it is taking approximately five hours to run each trial, and there are 30 trials anticipated to run in total. Through this analysis, the Optuna model now suggests that Trial 5 of the run was the best so far. Specfically, in trial 5, the overll results were the following- Trial 5 finished with value: 1.568453700251382e-11 and parameters: {'learning_rate': 0.00011567750686133205, 'optim': 'Adam', 'dropout': 0.5}. Best is trial 5 with value: 1.568453700251382e-11. 
  Then, I proceeded to work on the introduction of our group's paper. I followed the outline that I came up with yesterday and will improve the initial draft for this portion once my collaborator (another fellow group member) is done with their version of the introduction. Thus, we will synthesize our ideas to bring it all together.
  In the last 2 hours of the day, we had a team meeting about group dynamics to resolve miscommunications relating to how we communicate and convey our ideas. This conversation was certainly not any easy one to have. However, it definetly cleared the air and, hopefully, is a step towards the right direction to end the program on a strong, productive note. Also, I liked learning about how our group may deploy our Deep Learning Models on a free platform to test out its ability. I am looking forward to exploring the different avenues that this process will entail.
