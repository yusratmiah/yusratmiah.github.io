what_i_learned: |
  The day started off with a weekly CEAMLS SAIRI Cohort meeting, which was based on learning about the different learning styles and personalities that each individual has. I personally learned that I am primarily a visual learner that prefers learning through practical examples and well-thought out diagrams. Additionally, I found changes in my MBTI test results since previously I was a ISFJ (defender) and have now evolved into a ISTP (Virtuoso/Crafter). The most interesting part was when I learned that the rest of my team members are all ISTJs (Logistician). Through it all, we as a group came to conclusion that we can do a better job communicating ideas in an organized and accepting manner. 
  For the later half of the day, I spent time in the lab reviewing my results from Optuna and worked on drafting the literature paper in collaboration with my group members. Specifically, the Optuna run completed 19 trials and still has 11 more to go (hopefully will finish in 3 days). Then, I worked on bringing in together the different perspectives/suggestions for the abstract and introduction to find some middle ground (still working on this part to effectively compromise what should/should not be on the paper). I also explored some ways to enhance LaTex/Overleaf skills by working with a group member to find some effective resources to help us on crafting our literature paper in a professional manner. We also met with our faculty and graduate mentor to explain our overall progress and discuss the potential pitfalls related to our research, specifically related to the dataset, which was brought up by a fellow group member.

  I was a slightly confused about what exactly should be in the methodology. I got the guidelines clarified by my graduate mentor during the meeting once an example paper was shared with the group.
  
reflection: |
  Overall, today started off in an unexpected note since the notification to report to the Business building for the CEAMLS SAIRI cohort meeting was abrupt. The CEAMLS SAIRI Cohort meeting helped me better understand my visual learning style and how personality types shape collaboration. I noticed a shift in my MBTI results, evolving from ISFJ to ISTP, which gave me insight into my growth and preferences. In the lab, I reviewed Optuna’s trial results and actively contributed to drafting our group’s literature paper by integrating diverse perspectives. Meeting with our mentors deepened our awareness of dataset-related challenges, pushing us to think critically about how to refine our research moving forward.
