what_i_learned: |
  Today started off on an interesting note because when I arrived at my workstation, I noticed that my computer was shut off. This took me aback since my computer has been on for 6+ days because of Optuna running for a while (30 trials, each with 60 epochs). I suppose that the power was turned off in the building since I updated my computer system settings to "never" turn off. By encountering this setback, I learned that I can use SQLite to restore the Optuna run where it was paused and continue the process. Since I did not have this already set up, I had to scrap the Optuna run for now, but I did complete two additional runs on my original codebase with the Optuna-suggested hyperparameters and got high accuracies. Additionally, I looked more into the DenseNet-121 architecture and read more papers on it to correctly convey its architecture in the literature paper. I also contributed to the literature paper by clarifying some suggestions brought up by my peers and by adding some information about DenseNet to the paper.

  Unexpected workstation shutdown halted my long-running Optuna trials, prompting a shift to hyperparameter-based experiments and focused literature contributions while planning for future SQLite recovery integration.
  
reflection: |
  Today’s unexpected shutdown was a setback, but it pushed me to explore recovery options like SQLite and adapt my workflow. Although I had to abandon the ongoing Optuna trials, I salvaged progress by running experiments with the previously suggested hyperparameters, which yielded strong results. I also made meaningful contributions to the literature paper, clarifying DenseNet-121 insights and peer feedback. Tomorrow, I plan to finish writing the DenseNet-121 paragraph and run the model using the newly gathered data to further strengthen my analysis.
