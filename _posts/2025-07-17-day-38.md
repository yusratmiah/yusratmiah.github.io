what_i_learned: |
  This Thursday started off with the writing workshop, which explained how to effectively write the the literature paper. The lecturer, Dr. Pandey, also highlighted how to present properly by using minimal hand geatures and building up confidence and mastery on the topic you will be talking about. Then, for the later half of the day, I went back to my lab to conitnue working on my research. In particular, I made a DenseNet-121 Model using Draw.io and finished writing about the DenseNet-121 architecture for the literature review. Additionally, I ran the DenseNet-121 model and discovered that the confusion matrix that I was using was not correct when using sigmoid and then had to fix that issue with the help of a teammate.

  No blockers faced today. 
  
reflection: |
  The day went by really fast since a good portion of it was dedicated for the writer's workshop. I would say this week felt fast ebcause we had two cohort meetings this week and that disrupted the regular routine of working in the lab for around 7 hours each day. My goal for tomorrow is to finalize my DenseNet-121 Diagram, run more models using the new day, and also help out with writing the paper.
