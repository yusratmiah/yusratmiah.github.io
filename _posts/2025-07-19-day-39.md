what_i_learned: |
  I began my day by analyzing the model I ran using the Optuna results and noticed that, although accuracy remained high, precision was still low. I then focused on improving my team's literature paper by editing the sections I had contributed to. I consulted my high school teacher, Ms. Eneah, for advice on restructuring parts of the paper, particularly the abstract and introduction. Collaborating with my group members was a rewarding experience. Synthesizing our ideas helped us express our perspectives in a meaningful way.

reflection: |
  This week, I focused on analyzing the model I ran using the Optuna results and found that while accuracy was high, precision remained low. I also worked on refining my team's literature paper by editing my sections and discussing improvements, particularly to the abstract and introduction, with my high school teacher, Ms. Eneah. Collaborating with my group members was valuable as it helped us align our ideas and strengthen the overall direction of the paper. Next week, I plan to continue working on the literature paper, write the methodology section, and help deepen our group’s understanding of the ensemble model. We will also compile the results from each individual model and begin preparing our elevator pitch by drafting the script and editing the video, which is due next Thursday.
