  As I wrap up the day, one thing that stands out is how I had to be creative in the way I approached things. I emphasize 'creative' because, in many ways, how we present ideas to the world is a form of artistic expression. I see creativity in how we’re transforming our literature paper draft from simple words on a Google Doc into a well-organized technical paper on OverLeaf. Transformations like these don’t come easily at first, but when done with care and patience, they make weeks of hard work feel deeply meaningful. That’s something I’m gradually learning about the broader creative process throughout this research program.
  Later in the day, I discussed potential ways to complete the elevator pitch with my group members. The incorporation of a vehicle and showcasing our lab environment are some ideas that we came up with. We also would like to make sure that each group member has a part in the video. Therefore, we are still finalizing the script to make sure we contribute equally during the 60- to 90-second elevator pitch video. 
  Moreover, I watched a 1+ hour video titled "Deep Drowsiness Detection using YOLO, PyTorch, and Python" by Nicholas Renotte. Through this extensive tutorial, it reinforced that the YOLO computer vision model is a power tool that has essential features such as fast processing times and effective anchor boxes. 
  For the literature review, I drafted a flowchart explaining our methodology. I ran the flowchart by my mentor and was advised to reduce the size of it. I plan on doing it by refining the steps and experimenting with different shapes/sizes.

  I have been trying to integrate our Google Colab Base to a GUI that takes in real-time video data. Researching on this topic has been interesting, but implementing it may take longer than anticipated. 
  
reflection: |
  Today challenged me to be creative in how I approached both writing and collaboration. Our literature paper is evolving from raw ideas into a refined technical format on OverLeaf, highlighting the power of thoughtful transformation. In our group pitch planning, we brainstormed ways to balance visual storytelling and team participation, while I also explored YOLO’s strengths in a detailed tutorial that deepened my understanding of fast and efficient model performance. Finally, revising our methodology flowchart and researching GUI integration reminded me that refining small details can unlock big improvements over time.
