  My day began by comparing the results of two models I had run overnight. The new dataset yielded a validation accuracy of 95.16%, while the old dataset showed 100%. Since the new dataset reflects stronger credibility, I plan to experiment with different epoch settings: 10, 20, 30, 50, and 80 and cross-validate them against the 100-epoch run.
  I also created an updated draft of our methodology flowchart to visually outline the steps we took in our research. My initial version was quite detailed and included the more granular aspects. This time, I drew inspiration from a flowchart in the paper titled “Machine learning and deep learning techniques for driver fatigue and drowsiness detection: a review.” It effectively captured how researchers studied various stages of fatigue and assessed DDD levels.
  Later in the day, 1I took the lead on scripting our team’s elevator pitch. I focused on refining the language to highlight the professional and innovative nature of our project. For tone and delivery, I drew inspiration from Apple’s WWDC presentations, which excel at making technical content both compelling and accessible.

  I did have to get a little creative when creating the flowchart and writing the script.
  
reflection: |
  I would say that I was able to integrate my design ideas with technology today since I created a flowchart and crafted the sccript for the elevator pitch. Filming the elevator pitch as a group was a neat experience as it signified collaboration. I hope that we can have the same level of energy and excitement. My goal for tomorrow includes finalizing the elevator pitch video through filming the last portion (my portion) and editing the video with my team.
