what_i_learned: |
  Today was a juxposition of utilizing my technical writing skils and video editing skills. As I rising senior in college, the skills that I gained from my ENGL 3844 (Writing and Digital Media) class really kicked in today because I had to convey parts of my project in a concise and meaningful way. Interestingly, I used the video editing skills that I learned from the class to edit my group's elevator pitch. Producing and editing the elevator pitch was a pretty easy task for me since I previously have made some short films for ENGL 3844. The best parts of our Elevator pitch was that it included all group members (everyone had a speaking part!) and it featured various parts of our lab space (outside and inside). This video not only is engaging, it is also going to be a great piece of history to look back on.

  I did have to level up organization skils to keep track of the many parts of the video. Therfore, I took some time to seperate and rename the video and audio files. 
  
reflection: |
   I realized just how seamlessly my writing and video editing skills from ENGL 3844 came together to support my project. Editing the elevator pitch felt second nature thanks to my short film experience, which made the process efficient and enjoyable. Coordinating multiple video and audio elements pushed me to level up my organizational skills- renaming and sorting files became a quiet victory. Looking back, this project feels less like a task and more like a creative milestone worth celebrating.
