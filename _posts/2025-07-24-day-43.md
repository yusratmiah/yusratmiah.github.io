what_i_learned: |
  I started my day off my organizing a series of past models that I ran. I ran over 25 models, which means that I compiled a lot of data overall. I ended up completing some data analysis by developing some trend graphs and averaging the results. Taking these steps will help me convey the key finidngs on my research paper. My group and I also had a meeting with our graduate mentor. During this meeting we discussed ways to describe our results effectively, such as including tables and explaining how the results were derived. Our elevator pitch was also submitted. 
  To deploy our model to use it in real time, we used the Hugging Face platform that easily facilitates GUI interfaces for ML model. The Hugging Face platform is basically like a Github for Machine Learning. To run our model effectively, we had to make the following files and upload it to the platform: requirements.txt, app.py, and .h5 file that holds our ML model.

  It was a little bit of a learning curve when it came to figuring out the Hugging Face platform. I was able to figure it out through reading online documentation and collaborating with my group members!
  
reflection: |
  I feel like our project is finally at the point where it is ready to wrap up. I found it interesting how were all able to deploy our respective models that we each worked on. I had a good time testing out the models since I was able to test it out on both my laptop and phone. My goals for tomorrow is to finalize the results and help with the editing process of our paper.
