what_i_learned: |
  The first half of the day comprised learning about the Human-Technology Interaction Lab at the University of Alabama, led by Dr. Chris Crawford. The research itself was composed of the study of human-robot interactions, which initiated the creation of devices that are focused on the brain-computer interface. The aspect of the presentation that caught my attention the most was about the work related to semi-autonomous vehicles and how autonomous platoons can come into play to help ensure the safety of self-driving vehicles. In particular, autonomous platoons are vehicles in place (with no passengers) that are there to guide the self-driving cars with passengers to increase space between cars and help with managing traffic.
  When I got back to the lab, I worked on going through the various trials that I completed and complied the results by averaging the results. I also watched some Stanford Lectures related to programming to help solidify my approach on solving machine learning related problems.

  No blockers faced. 
  
reflection: |
  Today was relatively productive with a mix of interactive and independent activities. I feel good about what we accomplished this week, especially the elevator pitch video. There is certainly a need for better communication for our group to prepare for the final presentation. Otherwise, I am looking forward to recharging myself for the weekend and am excited to end the program on a high note next week.
