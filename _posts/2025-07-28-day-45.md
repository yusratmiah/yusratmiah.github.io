what_i_learned: |
  Today was interesting since only half of the team showed up to work. This meant that we had to push back the team meeting about finalizing our paper and presentation, which are both due by the end of the week. Therefore, I looked into that parts of the paper that still need work and made some meaningful contributions. First, I noticed that the discussion part of the paper still needed some content, so I consulted a handbook to learn what the key components of the discussion are. I learned that the discussion should include 3 to 5 key findings and highlight any limitations related to this research. 
  Then, I noticed that the results section still had some work to do since the tables needed to be added onto to Overleaf. I did have to look up some tutorials about adding tables and formatting on Overleaf. However, I was able to get it with some trial and error and also showed the process to a fellow teammate.

  No blockers faced. 
  
reflection: |
  Today was a reminder of how unpredictable teamwork can be, as only half the team showed up, delaying our plans to finalize the paper and presentation. Despite the setback, I took initiative by identifying gaps and making meaningful progress. I learned how to structure a strong discussion by focusing on key findings and limitations. I also developed new technical skills by figuring out how to format tables in Overleaf. Tomorrow, I plan on working on the final presentation and discussing parts of the paper that need some editing.
