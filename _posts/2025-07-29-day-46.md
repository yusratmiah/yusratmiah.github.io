  The day began with creating tables on Overleaf that were later synthesized to four major tables to reduce the number of tables in the paper. We as a group did this because we did not want the readers of our paper to be overwhelmed with the eight tables we orginally had. Then, each group member explained their key findings, which were based the major data points listed on the graphs.   Later in the day, we met up with Dr. Pandey of the Writing Center to get some feedback on ways to improve our overall message of the paper. Through this meeting, we realized that parts of our abstract were vague and that the discussion need more content. We recorded the meeting and took notes to document the parts of the paper that still needed some work.

  Overall, the race to the finish line has truly begun today. My group and I have a lot of moving parts, which include the Overleaf paper, finalizing the results, and the filming the live demo of our end product. We also have to figure out who is saying what during the presentation day. My goal tomorrow is to finish the results and discussion portions for the DenseNet-121 architecture. Furthermore, I would like to make some meaningful contributions to the final presentation.
