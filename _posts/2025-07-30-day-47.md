what_i_learned: |
  My day began with writing the results and the discussion paragraphs. These paragraphs were all about the DenseNet-121 architecture. I did have to rewrite some portions once I noticed some updated trends on the tables. I also took helped craft the live demo video. Lastly, I updated the final slide show presentation and made the methodology sections more concise so it is more readible for the audience.

  No blockers faced. 
  
reflection: |
  Today was the last day in the labs. I did have a bittersweet goodbye with the lab as it had its pros and cons. The pros was that we had a great space with a good ambiance and individual workstation PCs. However, the major con were that the lab itself was far away from the center of campus, which made it more difficult to commute for someone like me who solely depends on public transportation. While Morgan State offers shuttles to the North side of campus, the timings for the shuttles are all over the place, making them unpredictable and difficult to use. Through this whole experience, the kind interactions that I had with various CEAMLS SAIRI members is what makes this program meaningful and memorable.
