  bio: |
    I’m currently a senior at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Virginia, studying Computer Science with a minor in Data and Decision Sciences. I expect to graduate in December 2025.

    My work explores the intersection of Artificial Intelligence, Software Engineering, Design, and Transportation.

    When I’m not working on research, I enjoy reading books, keeping with automative trends, and exploring the outdoors.
