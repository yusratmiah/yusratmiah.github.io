  bio: |
    I‚Äôm currently a senior at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Virginia, studying Computer Science with a minor in Data and Decision Sciences. I expect to graduate in December 2025.

    My work explores the intersection of Artificial Intelligence, Software Engineering, Design, and Transportation.

    For Summer 2025, I am working on the Non-Contact AI-Drowsiness Detection System for Safe Driving Research Project. 
    This project involves deep learning and computer vision technologies. Through this experience, I hope to gain more insight about 
    the impact of advanced algorithms in society and the various processes that are required for conducting research ethically and methodically.

    I also have experience as a Undergraduate Researcher at Virginia Tech, where I worked on projects related to exploring how personal information is propagated online and space deorbiting systems. 

    When I‚Äôm not working on research, I enjoy reading books, keeping with automative trends, and exploring the outdoors.
