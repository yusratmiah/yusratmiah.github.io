project_title: "Non-Contact AI-Drowsiness Detection System for Safe Driving"

problem: |
  Driver drowsiness is a leading cause of road accidents, particularly on highways, contributing significantly to injuries, fatalities, and vehicle damage. Traditional drowsiness detection systems often rely on physical contact sensors, which can be intrusive or unreliable. There is a critical need for a more accurate, efficient, and non-invasive solution that can detect early signs of fatigue and alert drivers in real time to prevent accidents and save lives.

approach: |
  The project follows a multi-phase research and development approach:
  1. **Data Collection** – Capture real-time images and videos of drivers to gather training and testing data.
  2. **Model Development** – Use deep learning and transfer learning techniques to build predictive models that analyze eye movement and facial cues.
  3. **System Integration** – Combine the detection algorithm with a real-time monitoring and alert system using cameras and non-contact sensors.
  4. **Evaluation and Iteration** – Test system performance, gather feedback, and iteratively improve accuracy, responsiveness, and user experience.

outcome: |
  The expected outcome is a robust, non-contact AI-driven system capable of detecting drowsiness in drivers with high accuracy in real-time. It will use image and video analysis to monitor eye movements and facial cues, triggering immediate alerts to prevent accidents. By leveraging transfer learning and adaptive feedback, the system will continually improve its performance. Success will be measured by the student’s ability to build an effective predictive model, implement a functional monitoring and alert system, and document findings through technical reports. The project aims to enhance road safety and reduce fatigue-related accidents, while providing the student with practical experience in AI, machine learning, computer vision, and real-time system development.
