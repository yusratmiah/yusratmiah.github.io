subtitle: Neural Engineering & Assistive Robotics
project_title: "NeuroLink Assist: Adaptive Robotics through Brain Signal Decoding"

problem: |
  Individuals with severe motor disabilities often struggle with basic tasks that could be aided by robotic assistance. However, there is a lack of accessible and adaptive systems that respond naturally to the user's intent via brain-computer interfaces.

  This project seeks to explore how neural signals can be translated into reliable control commands for assistive robots, improving autonomy and quality of life.

approach: |
  The project follows a four-phase pipeline:

  - Collect EEG data during imagined movements using a non-invasive BCI headset
  - Train machine learning models to decode intent from neural patterns
  - Integrate real-time signal classification with a robotic arm interface
  - Evaluate system performance in simulated daily activities (e.g., object grasping, pointing)

  Open-source tools such as OpenBCI, Python (MNE, Scikit-learn), and ROS (Robot Operating System) will be used to prototype the system.

outcome: |
  By the end of the program, the project will result in a working prototype of a BCI-controlled robotic arm and a poster presentation outlining the system architecture, training pipeline, and evaluation metrics. Insights from the user study will inform future directions in adaptive assistive technology.
